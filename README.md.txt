In the game, I decided to make it so that the wrong options allow you to go back to the beginning until the narrator gets fed up with you.Instead of making it so that the loop repeats until you make the ¡°right¡± options, you technically make the wrong decisions, and that ends up ending the game. The branching options were based around actions you make during the date. The thought process behind the game¡¯s design was to make it feel kind of like a classic dating game, although with a few changes.
